# Skill Matrix

A refactoring of the beloved [Spring Petclinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic) to a skill matrix project.

## What is a skill matrix?

Here developers of a company can enter and rate their skills. Other people can search for skills and see which person has these skills.

## Running it

You can run it from Maven directly using the Spring Boot Maven plugin.

```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

You can then access it here: http://localhost:8080/
